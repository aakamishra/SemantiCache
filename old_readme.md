# Efficient LLM-Serving with Proxy Models

This repository contains the code for the paper "Efficient Interactive LLM Serving with Proxy Model-based Sequence Length Prediction" ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08509.pdf)).

The key idea/observation is that a small *proxy model* (i.e., a fine-tuned BERT-base model) can predict the LLM verbosity well given the input query.
Based on such a *proxy model*, we present the design and implementation of a speculative shortest-job-first (SSJF) scheduler for LLM serving, using a proxy-model-based sequence length predictor for execution time estimation.
SSJF can be directly applied (1) in existing LLM serving systems with no need to change the memory or key-value cache management, and (2) in various batching settings, i.e., no batching, dynamic batching, and continuous (iteration) batching (e.g., in Orca/vLLM).

## Overview

Below is the overall architecture of the proposed LLM-serving system:

Input requests from users are dispatched to corresponding models at runtime.
For each model instance, a request queue is maintained, and SSJF runs a speculative shortest-job-first scheduler to decide the request execution order.
SJF alleviates the non-determinism of generative models and the head-of-line blocking issue in FCFS scheduling.
Since we do not have the ground truth execution time of each request (required by SJF), SSJF relies on the prediction from an output token length predictor.
The prediction is used to estimate the job execution time in SJF as the output token length dominates the execution time (linear relation).
The predictor relies on a lightweight proxy model, i.e., a BERT-base model in our case.

The architecture of the proxy model is shown below:

We formulate the output token length prediction for each query as a regression problem (option #1) or a multi-class classification problem (option #2), as shown in (a).
In the regression task, the prediction is the absolute output token length while in classification, the prediction is a category of percentile values.
For example, in binary-class classification, two categories could be `[0, p50)` and `[p50, max]`, where `p50` is the median output token length based on historical LLM serving records.

An alternative formulation is that we can have a pairwise predictor, as shown in (b), whose input are two LLM queries (Q1 and Q2) and the prediction is 1 if Q1’s output is longer than Q2’s and 0 otherwise.
Given such a pairwise predictor, the SJF scheduler can insert any new arrival request to the sorted queue (based on output length) based on the pairwise prediction of the new request and any existing requests in the queue. However, evaluation results show that SJF with pairwise prediction has only ~3% improvement in JCT compared to FCFS (SSJF has >10× higher improvement).
Therefore, we do not proceed with this approach.

## Usage

### Requirements

The repo is tested on:
- Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
- Python 3.11.4
- Conda 23.9.0
- NVIDIA Tesla V100 (32GB)

```
conda create -n llm-env python=3.11 -y
conda activate llm-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Output Token Length Prediction

Training and evaluation dataset generation:

```
cd output-token-len-predictions
python preprocess_dataset.py [--FLAGS]
```

Training and evaluation of the output token length predictor:

```
python latency_prediction.py [--FLAGS]
```

### Predictor Types and Command Flags

Predictor supports four basic modes:
- Regression `--task_type 0`
- Binary Classification `--task_type 1`
- Multi-class Classification `--task_type 2`
- Multi-class Ordinal Classification `--task_type 3`
- Bi-class Ordinal Classification `--task_type 4`

For regression and ordinal classification, you can choose to use L1 loss or MSE loss during training:
- L1 loss `--l1_loss`
- MSE loss (simply no flag)

To enable multi-round support, add the `--multi_round` flag.

To train a customized predictor for a particular LLM model, you can use the `--model_name` flag to specify which LLM model.

To train a predictor for all models, use the `--all_models` flag.

To limit the data size, add the `--data_size` flag.

Example commands can be found in `output-token-len-prediction/script.sh`.

```
# by default predictor for vicuna-13b
# data generation (10K samples)
python preprocess_dataset.py --task_type 0 --data_size 10

# predictor training (regression with MSE loss)
python latency_prediction.py --task_type 0 --data_size 10

# predictor training (regression with L1 loss)
python latency_prediction.py --task_type 0 --l1_loss --data_size 10

# predictor training all LLMs
python preprocess_dataset.py --task_type 0 --data_size 10 --all_models
python latency_prediction.py --task_type 0 --data_size 10 --all_models

# predictor training for a particular LLM model
python preprocess_dataset.py --task_type 0 --data_size 100 --model_name "gpt-4"
python latency_prediction.py --task_type 0 --data_size 100 --model_name "gpt-4"
```
